;;; Commentary:

;; There are a few glaring ommisions from `ert', most notably,
;; re-running the last test you did and running this test, that I'm
;; looking at right now.

;; ertx provides both of those.  Install it, enable the mode in an
;; elisp file:

;;  M-x ertx-mode

;; and then use: 

;;  C-c t -- to jump to run a test when you are in it's definition
;;  C-c . -- to re-run the last test

;; A useful thing to do is to add ertx to the emacs-lisp hook so it's
;; always available in your emacs-lisp buffers:

;;  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'ertx-mode)

;; You might even want to customize that so you always have it
;; available.


;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

;;;###autoload
(defun ertx-this-defun ()
  "Run the tests for the ERT test where point rests."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (save-match-data
      (beginning-of-defun)
      (if (looking-at "(ert-deftest[ \t]\\([^ (]+\\)")
          (let* ((test-name (match-string-no-properties 1)))
            (unless (equal test-name (car ert--selector-history))
              (push test-name ert--selector-history))
            (ert test-name))
          (error "Not in an ert test?")))))

;;;###autoload
(defun ertx-run-last ()
  "Re-run the last test that you ran."
  (interactive)
  (ert (car ert--selector-history)))

(provide 'ertx)
